## Resources for next steps in your coding journey

Hopefully, this is not the last time you run into Python. You may feel like you want a more formal course in Python, you want to go back and teach yourself some basics or you might be ready to keep moving forward. Luckily there are many fantastic resources for all those options. I can't begin to write down everything, but I'll try my best to give some resources where I can :)

**Option 1: You want to take a more formal course.**

Take a course here at UCSD.

**Option 2: You want to teach yourself more basics.**

Luckily because there are millions of people every day who are learning and using Python there are a lot of resources online to learn Python. If you think you want more practice with basics such as working with loops and functions, you can use any good ones you find to practice. The best way to learn is by doing. For example, working through exercises that ask you to write your own code will be the most useful. I will provide some links to resources I know, but this list is by no means comprehensive.

[Here is a pretty thourough wiki on the Reddit page for learning Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index/)

**Option 3: You want to keep moving forward on your own.**

If you want to move forward learning how to code with some examples of what might be useful to neuroscience, I recommend looking over the free materials from Neuromatch Academy. This is a workshop for anyone from undergraduate students to PI's that occurs over the summer to teach programming for neuroscientists. They also publish for free online their materials. It is expected that you know the basics I have provided here but these give a good window into tools actual neuroscientists are using.
